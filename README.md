# PCAP_Lab_2

## Objective

Conduct PCAP analysis via Wireshark and provide a report on attack vectors used and various IOCs associated with malware infection.
This lab focuses specifically on an AsycRAT and XWorm infection.

### Skills Learned

- PCAP Analysis
- Detailed understanding of web traffic components as they relate to the OSI model
- Improved overall analytical skills
- Better understanding of encryption protocols and PKI framework

  
### Tools Used

- Wireshark
- NMAP

### Steps

Made a few changes to my setup this time around. I used my Kali Linux VM this time, instead of my Windows laptop. This was done to prevent accidental infection from file contained in the PCAP. I also created a new subnet for my VM, to prevent any infections spreading to the rest of my home network.
